*Particular method for indicator calculation

TL;DR: Run country-specific code in LISSY (this is called a Job in the platform), then obtain the .txt of the listing (recent jobs tab). 
       Use the txt_to_database.do to obtain the dataset changing the file location and the names of category variables of that particular survey. 

LISSY is a platform where you can send your Stata/R/SPSS/SAS code and obtain in txt and pdf format a record the results window. 
No datasets can be downloaded, so pretty much everything must be checked through tabulations or 'codebook'-like commands. 
The new code has been designed so that the listing (the 'output') of LISSY shows all the indicators in a line-by-line basis so that they can be transformed later. 
There are other minor changes into the category variables so that they are strings and the conversion to the dataset is straightforward. 
Once logged in to LISSY, you have to select the project (LIS, LWS, or ERFLIS depending on the dataset), the package (Stata/R/SPSS/SAS), and name the job. 
Then move from 'Edit job' to 'Recent jobs' on the top left corner, and select the last line with a green check (if it's not finished it will show a clock). 
Before you download the .txt , check on the listing tab to see if the code run correctly (check that the final lines are not an error number). 
If all is well click on the blue diskette and save a zipfile that contains the listing and extract that file, for example "listing_job_810208.txt"

Now it's time to use actual Stata. Open txt_to_database.do in the do-editor and replace the file location and the names of category variables. 
Run the code and it should produce a Stata dataset that looks like widetable output.
Browse the output and check the result :)

Few extra notes:
Despite the harmonization, for education variables categories are not the same across countries so the recode to obtain indicators must be revised. 
To help with this task, use exploring_datasets.do and replace the list of surveys in line 3 with the code of the surveys of interest.
